# Cross-Project References

Metano supports sharing types across **multiple C# projects** that each produce
their own npm package. This guide explains how it works and how to set it up.

## The scenario

You have a solution with multiple C# projects:

```
MySolution/
├── MySolution.Shared/          # → npm: @acme/shared
├── MySolution.Users/           # → npm: @acme/users (depends on Shared)
└── MySolution.Orders/          # → npm: @acme/orders (depends on Shared + Users)
```

Each project transpiles to its own npm package. Types in `Orders` can reference
types in `Users` and `Shared`, and the generated TypeScript gets the right
`import` statements and `package.json` entries **automatically**.

## Setup

### Each project declares its npm package identity

In each `.csproj`, add an `AssemblyInfo.cs` (or similar) with:

```csharp
using Metano.Annotations;

[assembly: TranspileAssembly]
[assembly: EmitPackage("@acme/shared", Version = "workspace:*")]
```

- **`[assembly: TranspileAssembly]`** — marks the assembly for whole-project
  transpilation (optional, but usually what you want)
- **`[assembly: EmitPackage(name, Version)]`** — the npm package name and the
  version specifier to use in consumer `package.json#dependencies`

The `Version` field is optional. Common values:

- `"workspace:*"` — for Bun/pnpm/Yarn workspace siblings
- `"^1.2.3"` — for a published npm version
- Omit entirely — Metano falls back to `workspace:*` if the assembly has no
  explicit `Version`, or `^Major.Minor.Patch` from the assembly's
  `Identity.Version` otherwise

### Consumer project references the producer via `ProjectReference`

In `MySolution.Users.csproj`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="../MySolution.Shared/MySolution.Shared.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This is a **normal .NET project reference**. Metano picks up the reference
during compilation, walks the referenced assembly's public types, and registers
them in its cross-assembly type map.

The TypeScript CLI also finds the target package root by walking upward from
`MetanoOutputDir` until it sees a `package.json`. If no package file is found,
it falls back to the legacy convention: the parent directory of the output
folder. Set `MetanoPackageRoot` when your generated files live somewhere unusual.

## What Metano generates

When a consumer uses a type from a referenced project, the transpiler:

1. **Resolves the type origin** — finds the producer assembly's `[EmitPackage]`
   name + the type's namespace path.
2. **Emits an `import` statement** — `import { TypeName } from "@acme/shared/namespace/path"`
3. **Adds a `package.json` dependency** — the consumer's generated `package.json`
   gets `"@acme/shared": "workspace:*"` automatically.
4. **Merges multiple names from the same barrel** — if you import `Money`,
   `Currency`, and `Price` all from `@acme/shared/finance`, they get one combined
   import line.

### Example

**`Shared/Money.cs`:**

```csharp
using Metano.Annotations;

[assembly: TranspileAssembly]
[assembly: EmitPackage("@acme/shared")]

namespace Acme.Shared.Finance;

public record Money(decimal Amount, string Currency);
```

**`Users/User.cs`:**

```csharp
using Acme.Shared.Finance;

namespace Acme.Users;

public record User(string Id, string Name, Money Balance);
```

**Generated `@acme/users/src/user.ts`:**

```typescript
import { HashCode } from "metano-runtime";
import { Money } from "@acme/shared/finance";

export class User {
  constructor(
    readonly id: string,
    readonly name: string,
    readonly balance: Money,
  ) {}
  // …
}
```

**Generated `@acme/users/package.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/users",
  "dependencies": {
    "@acme/shared": "workspace:*",
    "metano-runtime": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Namespace-first import resolution

Metano lays generated files out by their **full** kebab-cased C# namespace under
the package root — the on-disk path mirrors the fully-qualified name, with nothing
stripped (ADR-0025). The package name and the namespace are therefore both present
in a cross-package import:

| Producer type | Generated import |
|---|---|
| `Acme.Shared.Finance.Money` | `from "@acme/shared/acme/shared/finance"` |
| `Acme.Shared.Finance.Currency` | `from "@acme/shared/acme/shared/finance"` |

A cross-package import resolves to the namespace's **leaf barrel** (`index.ts`
inside that namespace directory), so multiple names from the same namespace merge
onto one import line. (This mirrors how the producing package emits its own files,
which keeps the two layouts in lock-step.)

**Within a single package**, references between generated types import the
**defining file directly** — `from "#/acme/shared/finance/money"` across
namespaces, or `from "./money"` within the same namespace — never through a barrel.
This keeps internal correctness independent of barrel emission and structurally
avoids ESM import cycles.

A single **opt-in** root aggregation barrel (`--namespace-barrels` /
`MetanoNamespaceBarrels`) re-exports the whole hierarchy under nested
`export namespace` blocks for consumers who prefer one entry point. It is opt-in
because, unlike the per-namespace leaf barrels, it defeats tree-shaking.

## Multiple packages, same type name

If two referenced assemblies both declare a public type called `User`, Metano
disambiguates at the **symbol level** (via Roslyn), not by string matching. Each
`User` ends up correctly imported from its own producing package — no collision.

## Publishing-friendly flow

When you publish your packages to npm:

1. Set `[assembly: EmitPackage(name, Version = "^x.y.z")]` with the concrete
   published version
2. Consumers see `"@acme/shared": "^x.y.z"` in their generated `package.json`
3. The normal npm/yarn/pnpm/bun install flow resolves dependencies

For monorepo development, use `Version = "workspace:*"` (or omit `Version`
entirely to let it fall back automatically) so Bun/pnpm/Yarn workspaces link
the packages symbolically.

## Diagnostics you might hit

### `MS0007` — Cross-package type without `[EmitPackage]`

If a referenced assembly has `[assembly: TranspileAssembly]` but **no**
`[assembly: EmitPackage]`, the transpiler doesn't know what npm package name to
use for imports. You'll get one `MS0007` error per type that's referenced from
that assembly.

**Fix:** add `[assembly: EmitPackage("name")]` to the producer.

### `MS0008` — Conflicting namespaces under the same `[EmitInFile]` name

If two types share `[EmitInFile("foo")]` but live in different C# namespaces,
Metano rejects the setup because consumers can't resolve which file to import
from. Move them into the same namespace or use different file names.

## The `.metalib` future (NuGet packaging)

The current cross-project flow works for **source-available** dependencies (via
`ProjectReference` in the same solution, or source packages). For NuGet packages
that don't include source, Metano needs a metadata sidecar file called
`.metalib` to provide the type signatures without full source access.

**Status:** not yet implemented. Tracked as
[issue #27](https://github.com/danfma/metano/issues/27) — schema, generation,
embedding, and consumption. The design rationale for reusing Roslyn compilation
references as the primary cross-assembly channel (and leaving `.metalib` as an
additive follow-up) is captured in
[ADR-0004](adr/0004-cross-project-references-via-roslyn.md).

For now, share source via `ProjectReference` within the same solution or via a
monorepo.
